Context: User provided comprehensive analysis of TLS 1.3 and MCP Prompts specifications

Key Insights Discovered:

1. **TLS 1.3 Transparency**: Modern deployment platforms (Cloudflare Workers) handle TLS 1.3 automatically
   - No manual TLS configuration needed
   - Focus on OAuth application security instead
   - 1-RTT handshake improves performance
   - Forward secrecy enhances token transport security

2. **MCP Prompts as Game-Changer**: Prompts enable slash command discovery in Claude UI
   - Users can see and invoke lorem templates directly
   - Pre-configured templates for common use cases
   - Better UX than programmatic tool calls
   - Natural discovery mechanism for non-technical users

3. **Dual API Strategy**: Tools + Prompts provide complementary functionality
   - Tools: Fine-grained programmatic control
   - Prompts: User-friendly template-based generation
   - Synergistic approach maximizes usability

Implementation Strategy Changes:

1. **Elevated Prompts Priority**: Updated implementation plan to prioritize prompts alongside tools
2. **Template Categories Defined**:
   - Content: email, blog, social media, product descriptions
   - Developer: API docs, code comments, README, error messages
   - Creative: story outlines, dialogue, poetry, scripts
   - UI: component text, mockups, design systems

3. **Technical Architecture**:
   - Capability declaration includes prompts with listChanged: true
   - Prompt handler class with template registry
   - Rich content support with embedded resources
   - Argument validation and tone/style variations

Testing Considerations:
- MCP Inspector must validate both tools AND prompts
- Slash command testing in Claude Desktop
- Template rendering and argument handling
- Error scenarios for malformed prompts

Future Enhancements Identified:
- Dynamic prompt generation based on user preferences
- Multi-language lorem ipsum support
- Industry-specific jargon generators
- Integration with design tool workflows

Security Notes:
- TLS 1.3 provides automatic transport security
- OAuth flows benefit from encrypted handshake privacy
- Certificate management handled by CDN platforms
- Focus security efforts on application-layer validation

This analysis fundamentally changes the project's value proposition from basic lorem generation to a comprehensive template-based content creation system accessible through natural Claude UI interactions.
