# Setup Process Documentation

## Prompt Context
User requested creation of a public repository with comprehensive description and topics, utilizing ghq directory structure for repository management. The goal was to establish an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Lorem Ipsum generator server.

## Environment
- Platform: FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE
- Working Directory: /home/jwalsh/ghq/github.com/aygp-dr/mcp-lorem
- Repository Manager: ghq
- GitHub User: aygp-dr (Aidan Pace)

## Repository Configuration
- Name: mcp-lorem
- Visibility: Public
- Description: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Lorem Ipsum generator - Provides Lorem Ipsum text generation capabilities through the MCP protocol for AI assistants and language models
- Topics: mcp, lorem-ipsum, ai-tools, llm, text-generation, developer-tools, anthropic-claude, model-context-protocol

## Initial Setup Decisions

### Architecture Considerations
1. **Dual Implementation Strategy**: Planned both local (Python) and remote (TypeScript) servers to maximize compatibility
2. **OAuth Support**: Included comprehensive OAuth 2.0 implementation plans for remote deployment
3. **Multi-Client Support**: Designed to work with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Emacs mcp.el
4. **Extensibility**: Built-in support for multiple Lorem Ipsum styles (standard, cicero, bacon, hipster)

### Technology Stack Selection
- **Local Server**: Python with MCP SDK for simplicity and rapid prototyping
- **Remote Server**: TypeScript for better Claude integration and Cloudflare Workers deployment
- **Package Distribution**: GitHub Packages npm registry for versioned releases
- **Testing**: MCP Inspector for protocol compliance validation

### Project Structure Rationale
- Separated core logic from transport layers (local/remote)
- Included comprehensive examples for different client integrations
- Planned test coverage for all components
- Documentation-first approach with setup.org as living specification

## Implementation Phases
1. Core Lorem Engine (language-agnostic logic)
2. Local MCP Server (immediate testing capability)
3. Remote Server with OAuth (production deployment)
4. NPM Package Configuration (distribution)
5. Testing and Integration (validation)

## Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authorization
- Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) support
- IP whitelisting for Claude endpoints
- Rate limiting and token rotation strategies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core generation logic
- Integration tests with MCP Inspector
- Manual testing with Claude Desktop/Code
- Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## Deviations from Standard Practices
- Used .org format for setup documentation (more structured than Markdown for complex specs)
- Included mermaid diagrams for visual architecture documentation
- Pre-planned for multiple Lorem Ipsum variants beyond standard implementation
- Built-in support for future protocol extensions (subscriptions, sampling)

## Future Considerations
- Resource subscriptions when Claude supports them
- Custom word bank management via resources API
- Potential WebAssembly compilation for browser-based usage
- Integration with other MCP-compatible clients beyond Claude

## References Consulted
- MCP Specification (modelcontextprotocol.io)
- OAuth 2.0 RFCs (7591, 8707, 9728)
- Claude MCP implementation guides
- EmacsWiki LoremIpsum for feature parity
