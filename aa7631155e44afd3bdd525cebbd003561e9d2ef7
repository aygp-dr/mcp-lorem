Context: User provided comprehensive quick reference guide for MCP Lorem implementation

Prompt: Complete org-mode formatted quick reference with:
- Claude MCP integration points and OAuth endpoints
- 5-phase implementation checklist (local dev to production)
- Decision tree for implementation choices
- Common gotchas with solutions
- Minimal working code examples
- Testing command cheatsheet
- Resource links and final tips

Implementation Strategy:
- Saved as quick-reference.org for immediate developer use
- Structured as actionable checklist with clear phases
- Included both authless and OAuth implementation paths
- Provided Claude-specific configuration values
- Added testing tools and debugging commands

Key Decisions:
1. Start with authless local server for rapid prototyping
2. Use Python for local development, TypeScript for remote
3. Cloudflare Workers as preferred deployment platform
4. MCP Inspector as primary testing tool
5. GitHub Packages for npm distribution

Success Metrics Defined:
- Local server working with MCP Inspector
- OAuth flow completing without errors
- Claude Desktop integration successful
- Error handling and documentation complete
- Published to package registries

Next Steps for Implementation:
1. Begin with Phase 1 (local development)
2. Use provided Python example as starting point
3. Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
4. Follow the 5-day timeline for systematic progress
5. Reference gotchas section to avoid common pitfalls

Educational Value:
- Serves as both tutorial and reference
- Bridges MCP specification with practical implementation
- Provides Claude-specific integration details
- Includes real-world testing and deployment guidance
