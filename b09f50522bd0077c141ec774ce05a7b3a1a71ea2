Context: User requested guidelines for other agents working on the project

Prompt: "git status and add guidelines for other agents in .claude/ or show me what to add to memory"

Implementation Decisions:
- Created .claude/mcp-lorem.md as project-specific guidelines
- Included comprehensive development workflow and practices
- Documented current implementation status for continuity
- Added technical decisions and architecture references
- Provided testing and deployment commands

Considerations:
- Balanced between detailed guidance and maintainability
- Referenced setup.org as source of truth to avoid duplication
- Included security reminders for OAuth implementation
- Added practical commands for immediate productivity

Testing Strategy:
- Local testing with MCP Inspector
- Integration testing with Claude clients
- Continuous validation of protocol compliance

Future Agents Should:
1. Read setup.org for full specifications
2. Follow conventional commit standards
3. Use git notes for extended documentation
4. Test with MCP Inspector before commits
5. Update status tracking in guidelines
